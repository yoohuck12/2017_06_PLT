1. Convert the original log directly output from WProf-instrumented browser or mobile browser

We store the logs from all the page loads in a big file or a big DB. We need to split it to small log files, each represents a page load. Note that it might ask you to install some perl packages such as JSON.

For desktop browser (in text format),

$ perl slice.pl DIRECTORY_NAME_THAT_CONTAINS_LOG_FILES

For mobile browser (in sqlite3 db format),

$ perl slicemobile.pl DIRECTORY_NAME_THAT_CONTAINS_LOG_FILES

The sliced files will be stored in the same subdirectory as the original directory with suffix _pro.

-----------------------------
2. Prepare sliced files

Add the folder that contains the sliced log files to data/

Configure the path of the added folder in ProcessMain.pm, search for "test" and see where configuration should be done.


-----------------------------
3. Run the analysis

$ perl analysis.pl


-----------------------------
4. Understand the results

./temp_files/* generates a file per log file that contains the analyzed info for a certain page load. Here, we only consider the page load with minimum page load time for a given page.

./results/* combines all results from ./temp_files/* and generates files for CDF plots.


-----------------------------
5. Plot

Configure plot.pl accordingly the files to plot.

$ cd plot/
$ perl plot.pl
